# A.T.S.P.-Red-Cogs
Plugins for the [Discord bot Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)  
These cogs are either self-coded or modified from others. I'll definitely link to source.  
These cogs are being used on the [A.T.S.P](https://yamahi.eu) [Discord Server](http://s.yamahi.eu/chat) for several different tasks.
