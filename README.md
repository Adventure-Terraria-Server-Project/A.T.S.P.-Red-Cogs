# A.T.S.P.-Red-Cogs
Plugins for the [Discord bot Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)  
These cogs are either self-coded or modified from others. I'll definitely link to source.  
These cogs are being used on the [A.T.S.P](https://yamahi.eu) [Discord Server](http://s.yamahi.eu/chat) for several different tasks.

## Reminder
**"Forked" from [RemindMe](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-Cogs/)**  
Reminds you, or someone else after a specific time amount in a channel. Needs **python-dateutil** now!  
Install cog  
`[p]cog install atsp reminder`

### Commands

* remind  
  *Either reminds you "me" or reminds another user. You can use their actual nick, the loginname with and without the #Numbers or just @Mention.*

## RSS
**"Forked" from [RSS](https://github.com/tekulvw/Squid-Plugins)**  
Posts new feed entries in the desired channels. The fork includes filtering for keywords in the title and removing HTML-tags in the description. Needs **BeautifulSoup** now!    
Install cog  
`[p]cog install atsp rss`

### Commands
* add  
* filter
* filter_reset  
* force
* list

## Whitelist
**"Forked" from [Mod](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/develop/cogs/mod.py#L1131)**
Allows only the messages containing all of the set keywords. The opposite of the filter command. Keywords are set per channel instead globaly for a whole server. Deleted messages are posted to a specified channel instead of the log.
